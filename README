The new meta operations that Mau-Dev provides (with respect to 
the official Maude release) can be consulted in

Also, for Mau-Dev to run properly in Windows you need to install 
Cygwin and add the ~\Cygwin\bin folder to the PATH variable of 
your system. Note that after installing Cygwin and adding the bin 
folder to your PATH you don't need to execute Mau-Dev from within 
the Cygwin console itself; you can run it from the standard Windows 
console of %windir%\system32\cmd.exe

You can get a guide on how to install Cygwin in

However, note that this is a compilation guide for Maude, and thus 
explains how to install a lot of extra packages that you will not 
need, since a default Cygwin installation will suffice.
